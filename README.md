Official repository for the paper "An Efficient Artificial Intelligence Energy Management System for Urban Building Integrating Photovoltaic and Storage" [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10049578).

This work is the outcome of the ULISSE project concerning the optimization of a Residential PV plant, developed in the scope of the ASP program [link](https://www.asp-poli.it/).

Note that the results presented in the paper are obtained on a private dataset which we obtained in cohoperation with a company, and thus it cannot be released.
For this reason it is not possible to fully reproduce numbers from the paper; however we believe in the value of open source research and so we release the code hoping it might turn useful to the community.
